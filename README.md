# authentrip-api
This API is a backend service for the authentrip mobile application. This api will query for tipping ettiquette and exchange rates for the location where the customer resides and will query for nearby ATMs that service Discover cards.

This app was produced as part of the hackyourtrip hackathon, sponsored by discover. They deserve much of the credit for making this possible.

## Use
To use this app, hit one of our endpoints. We only have a few, and they are tailored to the front end app.

## Contributing
Unless you can argue that the your PR will benefit the front end application, you pull request will be denied. Feel free to fork the app amd make the changes yourself!

## Sources
Thanks once again to Discover for gathering the authentrip app development team. We use their APIs for our service.
